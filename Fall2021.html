                  <h2 class="section-heading">Employer Information</h2>
                  <p>My employer was Physical Resources of the University of Guelph. I assisted with the information
                     technology department of Physical Resources. Physical Resources builds, operates, and maintains
                     the physical assets of the University. They provide support services to the entire Campus.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>
                  <p>My goals for this work term was to improve my skills with instruction giving and problem-solving.
                     These skills were improved when I was required to help clients with any technical issues and
                     creating How-To documents for users. I was able to complete these goals, but they can definitely
                     be improved further.</p>
                  <p>I also had a goal to learn and use ASP.NET. I learned how to use ASP.NET and created a basic website
                     to play around with the features that it supplies. It was unfortunate that I was unable to apply
                     the knowledge I learned in this work term. I hope in the future this knowledge will help me in the
                     future.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>
                  <p>Some basic tasks that I've done in my work term are:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                     <li>- Software and Hardware Upgrades/Updates<li/>
                     <li>- Workstation Installations<li/>
                     <li>- Asset Management<li/>
                  </ul>
                  <p>I was given the task to design and create 3D prints. This task allowed me to learn how to use a
                     program called Fusion 360 to create models. I then used another program, Simiplify3D, to convert
                     my models into files to be read by a 3D printer to print out the model. This helped improve my
                     problem-solving skills as there are many variables to 3D printing to create successful prints.<p/>
                  <p>A major project that occured during my work term was a server migrations. This task entailed of
                     hardware upgrading, profile transfering, updating DNS, and joining the new domain.<p/>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>
                  <p>In all, this was a very enjoyable work term where I was able to learn a lo, meet great people, and
                     I was able to progress further with my goals. Thank you for reading my reflections upon this work
                     term.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Acknowledgements</h2>
                  <p>I would like to thank my supervisors, Andrew Hickingbottom and Nathan Griff, for the opportunity
                     to learn about information technology when I had no knowledge of the field. You guys are awesome!
