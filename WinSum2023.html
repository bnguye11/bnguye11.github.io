                  <h2 class="section-heading">Employer Information</h2>
                  <p>My employer was the Computing and Communications Services (CCS) of the University of Guelph.
                     CCS assists many different departments throughout the University with information technology,
                     information security, file databases, and many more. I assisted with the Managed Desktop department
                     of CCS for a 8-month work term. At Managed Desktops our overall responsibilities were to support
                     endpoint users. With devices that are under the University's Group policy.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>
                  <p>I had a goal to improve my oral communication skills. Oral communication is used widely in any
                     workplace, with colleagues or clients. I usually try to solve the issue myself, but some problems
                     are solved faster if I ask questions when I am stuck. My goal is to improve my oral communication
                     skills and be able to provide meaningful input in conversations. To work on this goal I asked
                     questions after an appropriate time working on an issue by myself. I talked to clients to identify
                     the problems they are encountering. Throughout the work term, I got many opportunities to work with
                     clients and was able to communicate what I am doing to help them resolve the issue, allowing them
                     to understand the process of fixing the issue. I try to complete tasks without much assistance from
                     my colleagues. When I get to a roadblock that I can't overcome, I asked for assistance and troubleshoot.
                     I feel more confortable talking to others, but communication will always be a skill that can be improved upon</p>
                  <p>My goal was to improve my technological literacy. Many programs and systems are usually unfamiliar
                     in a new workplace. I aim to understand the technologies and systems CCS utilize in their workplace.
                     I have played around with the program and systems that the CCS use. Since I used their technologies
                     every day I was able to improve my knowledge about them. I knew I was successful when I was able
                     help new co-ops with the ticketing system and group policy systems that was used. Overall, I was able
                     to improve my technological literacy and I am ready to improve it by learning new software and systems.
                     </p>
                  <p>A common issue in IT is identifying, troubleshooting, and solving problems. My goal is to improve
                     my problem-solving skills. I asked questions to my colleagues to learn solutions to common issues and
                     studied previous cases and applied their solutions to client's problems. I was able to improve my
                     problem solving skills and hope to continue to develope it.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>
                  <p>Some basic tasks that I've done in my work term are:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                     <li>- On-Call Technology Assistance</li>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                           <li>- Software or Hardware Issues</li>
                           <li>- Software Installations</li>
                        </ul>
                     <li>- Software and Hardware Upgrades/Updates</li>
                     <li>- Workstation Installations</li>
                     <li>- Printer Setup</li>
                     <li>- Device Setup</li>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                           <li>- Desktops and Laptops</li>
                           <li>- Mobile Phones</li>
                           <li>- UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)</li>
                        </ul>
                     <li>- Asset Management</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>These basic tasks required critical thinking and problem-solving. Setup tasks required the
                     following procedures to ensure a standard. Communication was also needed with users to set up a
                     meeting.<p/>
                  <p>Another task that was commonly given was to build devices. The computer was connected to the university's
                     internet and booted through PXE to receive files to setup the device. It will run through WinPE to install
                     the necessary software and set the group policy on the laptop. Once the process is finish, I log onto
                     the device and install Dell Command | Updates and Windows updates. Once that is complete, I message the
                     client that their laptop is ready for pickup<p/>
                  <<p>Decommissioning devices is a task that comprised of wiping all storage components and destroying them
                     afterwards, everything is then placed into E-waste. A ticket is then created and assigned to the analyst
                     to remove the device from Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, Active Directory, and the anti-virus software.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>
                  <p>In all, this was an enjoyable and welcoming work term where I was able to expand my understanding,
                     meet great people, and I progressed further with my goals. Thank you for reading my reflections upon
                     this work term.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Acknowledgements</h2>
                  <p>I like to thank my supervisor, Brian Thomson, for the opportunity to work with CCS.
                     Also many thanks to the IT Technician and Analyst for the help when I asked for it.
                  </p>
