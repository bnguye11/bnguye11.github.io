                  <h2 class="section-heading">Employer Information</h2>
                  <p>My employer was Physical Resources of the University of Guelph. I assisted with the information
                     technology (IT) department of Physical Resources. Physical Resources builds, operates, and
                     maintains physical assets of the University. They provide support services to the entire Campus.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>
                  <p>I had a goal to improve my skills and understanding of 3D printing technology. I worked on this
                     goal by practicing many Fusion360 functions. I was able to create models quickly while maintaining
                     quality. Another thing I learned for this goal was multi-colour 3D prints. Within the 3D model
                     slicing software, I learned a script to pause the 3D printing at a predefined layer. I then removed
                     the current filament and replaced it with a different colour. One application of this was creating
                     QR codes. QR codes need contrasting colours for devices to scan the code. I received a new 3D
                     printer to take home for personal use. I learned how to assemble and maintain my 3D printer.
                     These situations aided in the completion of this goal.</p>
                  <p>My goal was to improve my oral communication. To improve on this goal, I tried to ask questions
                     about tasks if I could not find a solution or for clarification. Also,  I would give my opinion on
                     issues to help facilitate critical thinking. Although these situations aided progress towards my
                     goal, I would still like to improve my oral skills as it is the area that needs the most
                     development.</p>
                  <p>I also had a goal to apply my knowledge of ASP.NET, which I learned from my last work term. I
                     received a task to search through an ASP.NET code base and fix an issue that occurred in the
                     program. I was able to locate where the problem was and created code to solve it. I then sent my
                     edits to the live website to confirm that the solution worked. I am glad I can apply the knowledge
                     I learned in my last work term.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Job Description</h2>
                  <p>Some basic tasks that I've done in my work term are:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                     <li>- On-Call Technology Assistance</li>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                           <li>- Software or Hardware Issues</li>
                           <li>- Software Installations</li>
                        </ul>
                     <li>- Software and Hardware Upgrades/Updates</li>
                     <li>- Workstation Installations</li>
                     <li>- Printer Setup</li>
                     <li>- Device Setup</li>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                           <li>- Desktops and Laptops</li>
                           <li>- Mobile Phones</li>
                           <li>- UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)</li>
                        </ul>
                     <li>- Asset Management</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>These basic tasks required critical thinking and problem-solving. Setup tasks required the
                     following procedures to ensure a standard. Communication was also needed with users to set up a
                     meeting.<p/>
                  <p>I was assigned the task of designing and creating 3D prints. This task allowed me to learn how to
                     use a modeling program called Fusion 360 to create models. I then used Simiplify3D to convert my
                     models into files read by a 3D printer to print out the model. It helped improve my problem-solving
                     skills as there are many variables to 3D printing to create successful prints.<p/>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>
                  <p>In all, this was an enjoyable work term where I was able to expand my understanding,
                     met great people, and I progressed further with my goals. Thank you for reading my reflections upon
                     this work term.</p>
                  <h2 class="section-heading">Acknowledgements</h2>
                  <p>I like to thank my supervisors, Andrew Hickingbottom, Chris Payne, and Nathan Griff, for the
                     opportunity to return to Physical Resources. Also many thanks for the 3D printer Chris! I am still
                     baffled that you just gave it to me. I will continue to use and learn about this technology.
                  </p>
